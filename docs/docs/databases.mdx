# Databases

## Create or Open Database

You can create a new database and-or open an existing database, using the
`api|Database` class. The database class provides both synchronous and
asynchronous methods for opening and closing databases (see
[explanation for Synchronous and Asynchronous APIs](/general-concepts.mdx#sync-and-async-apis)).
Just pass in a database name and optionally a `api|DatabaseConfiguration` - see
[Example 1](#).

Things to watch for include:

- If the named database does not exist in the specified, or default, location
  then a new one is created.
- The database is created in a default location unless you specify a directory
  for it — see: `api|DatabaseConfiguration.directory`.

  :::tip

  Best Practice is to always specify the path to the database explicitly.

  :::

  See [Supported Platforms](./supported-platforms.mdx) for the default location
  for each platform.

<CodeExample id={1} title="Opening a Database">

<APITabs>
<APITab api="Async">

```dart
final database = await Database.openAsync('my-database');
```

</APITab>
<APITab api="Sync">

```dart
final database = Database.openSync('my-database');
```

</APITab>
</APITabs>

</CodeExample>

## Close Database

You are advised to incorporate the closing of all open database into your
application workflow.

Closing a database is simple, just call use `api|Database.close`. See
[Example 2](#). This also closes active replications, listeners, and-or live
queries connected to the database.

<CodeExample id={2} title="Closing a Database">

```dart
await database.close();
```

</CodeExample>

## Database Encryption

<EnterpriseFeatureCallout />

Couchbase Lite includes the ability to encrypt Couchbase Lite databases. This
allows mobile applications to secure data at rest, when it is being stored on
the device. The algorithm used to encrypt the database is 256-bit AES.

### Enabling

To enable encryption, use `api|DatabaseConfiguration.encryptionKey` to set the
encryption key of your choice. Provide this encryption key every time the
database is opened - see [Example 3](#).

<CodeExample id={3} title="Opening an Encrypted Database">

```dart
final key = await EncryptionKey.passwordAsync('secret password');
final config = DatabaseConfiguration(encryptionKey: key);
final database = await Database.openAsync('my-database', config);
```

</CodeExample>

### Persiting

Couchbase Lite does not persist the key. It is the application's responsibility
to manage the key and store it in a platform specific secure store such as
Apple's
[Keychain](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services)
or Android's
[Keystore](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore).

### Opening

An encrypted database can only be opened with the same language SDK that was
used to encrypt it in the first place. So a database encrypted using the Dart
SDK, and then exported, is readable only by the Dart or C SDK.

### Changing

To change an existing encryption key, open the database using its existing
encryption-key and use `api|Database.changeEncryptionKey` to set the required
new encryption-key value.

### Removing

To remove encryption, open the database using its existing encryption-key and
use `api|Database.changeEncryptionKey` with a `null` value as the encryption
key.

## Database Maintenance

From time to time it may be necessary to perform certain maintenance activities
on your database, for example to compact the database file, removing unused
documents and blobs no longer referenced by any documents.

Couchbase Lite's API provides the `api|Database.performMaintenance` method. The
available maintenance operations, including compact are as shown in the enum
`api|enum:MaintenanceType` to accomplish this.

This is a resource intensive operation and is not performed automatically. It
should be run on-demand using the API. If in doubt, consult Couchbase support.

## Command Line Tool

cblite is a command-line tool for inspecting and querying Couchbase Lite
databases.

You can download and build it from the couchbaselabs
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-mobile-tools/blob/master/README.cblite.md).
Note that the cblite tool is not supported by the
[Couchbase Support Policy](https://www.couchbase.com/support-policy).

## Couchbase Lite for VSCode

Couchbase Lite for VSCode is a Visual Studio Code extension that provides a user
interface for inspecting and querying Couchbase Lite databases. You can find
more information about this extension from it's
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/vscode-cblite).

## Troubleshooting

You should use console logs as your first source of diagnostic information. If
the information in the default logging level is insufficient you can focus it on
database errors and generate more verbose messages (see `api|enum:LogLevel`)
— see: [Example 4](#).

<CodeExample id={4} title="Increase level of Database Log Messages">

```dart
Database.log.console.level = LogLevel.verbose;
```

</CodeExample>
