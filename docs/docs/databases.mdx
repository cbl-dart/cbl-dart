## Create or Open Database

You can create a new database and-or open an existing database, using the Database class.  The database class provides both synchronous and asynchronous methods for opening and closing databases.  Just pass in a database name and 
optionally a database configuration - see Example 1.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="async" label="async" default>

```dart
try {
  final databaseDirectory = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  final cblDatabaseDirectory = databaseDirectory.subDirectory('databases');
  var dbConfig =
          DatabaseConfiguration(directory: cblDatabaseDirectory.path);

  database = await Database.openAsync('my-database', dbConfig);

} catch(e){
  debugPrint(e.toString());
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sync" label="synchronous">

```dart
try {
  database = Database.openSync('my-database');
} catch(e){
  debugPrint(e.toString());
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

###### Example 1 - opening a database

## Close Database

You are advised to incorporate the closing of all open database into your application workflow.  

Closing a database is simple, just call the close method on the database instance.  See Example 2.  

> **NOTE**:  This also closes active replications, listenres, and-or live queries connected to the database.  Closing a database soon after starting a replication involving it can cause an exeption as the asynchronous replicator my not yet be connected.

```dart
try {
  await database.close();
} catch(e){
  debugPrint(e.toString());
}
```

###### Example 2 - closing a database 

## Database Encryption
> **IMPORTANT** -  This feature is only available in the Enterprise Edition of Couchbase Lite.  If you are using the Community Edition, this feature will not be available.

Couchbase Lite Enterprise Edition includes the ability to encrypt Couchbase Lite databases.  This allows mobile applications to secure data at rest, when it is being stored on the device.  The algorithm used to encrypt the database is 256-bit AES.

### Enabling

To enable database encryption, you must set the encryption key on the database configuration.  Provide this encryption key every time the database is opened - see Example 3.

```dart
try {
  final databaseDirectory = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();

  final cblDatabaseDirectory = databaseDirectory
                              .subDirectory('databases');
  var key = await EncryptionKey
                    .passwordAsync('this is my super secrete key');

  var dbConfig = DatabaseConfiguration(
            directory: cblDatabaseDirectory.path, 
            encryptionKey: key);

  database = await Database.openAsync('my-database', dbConfig);

} catch(e){
  debugPrint(e.toString());
}
```
###### Example 3 - opening an encrypted database 

### Persiting

Couchbase Lite does not persist the key. It is the application’s responsibility to manage the key and store it in a platform specific secure store.

### Opening
An encrypted database can only be opened with the same language SDK that was used to encrypt it in the first place. So a database encrypted using the Dart SDK, and then exported, is readable only by the Dart or C SDK.

### Changing
To change an existing encryption key, open the database using its existing encryption-key and use [Database.changeEncryptionKey](https://github.com/cbl-dart/cbl-dart/blob/main/packages/cbl/lib/src/database/database.dart#L523) to set the required new encryption-key value.

### Removing
To remove encryption, open the database using its existing encryption-key and use [Database.changeEncryptionKey](https://github.com/cbl-dart/cbl-dart/blob/main/packages/cbl/lib/src/database/database.dart#L523) with a null value as the encryption key.

## Database Maintenance

From time to time it may be necessary to perform certain maintenance activities on your database, for example to compact the database file, removing unused documents and blobs no longer referenced by any documents.

Couchbase Lite’s API provides the [Database.performMaintenance](https://github.com/cbl-dart/cbl-dart/blob/main/packages/cbl/lib/src/database/database.dart#L520) method. The available maintenance operations, including compact are as shown in the enum [MaintenanceType](https://github.com/cbl-dart/cbl-dart/blob/main/packages/cbl/lib/src/database/database.dart#L39) to accomplish this.

This is a resource intensive operation and is not performed automatically. It should be run on-demand using the API. If in doubt, consult Couchbase support.

## Command Line Tool
cblite is a command-line tool for inspecting and querying Couchbase Lite databases.

You can download and build it from the couchbaselabs [GitHub repository](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-mobile-tools/blob/master/README.cblite.md). Note that the cblite tool is not supported by the [Couchbase Support Policy](https://www.couchbase.com/support-policy).

## Couchbase Lite for VSCode

Couchbase Lite for VSCode is a Visual Studio Code extension that provides a user interface for inspecting and querying Couchbase Lite databases.  You can find more information about this extension from it's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/vscode-cblite).

## Troubleshooting

You should use console logs as your first source of diagnostic information. If the information in the default logging level is insufficient you can focus it on database errors and generate more [verbose messages](https://github.com/cbl-dart/cbl-dart/blob/main/packages/cbl/lib/src/log/logger.dart#L24) — see: Example 4.

```dart
 Database.log.custom!.level = LogLevel.debug
```
