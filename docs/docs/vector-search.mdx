# Vector Search

Vector search is available but the Dart specific documentation for vector search
is not available yet.

Since the Dart API is very similar to the Swift API, you can refer to the
[Swift documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/couchbase-lite/current/swift/vector-search.html)
in the meantime.
