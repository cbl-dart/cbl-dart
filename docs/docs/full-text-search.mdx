# Using Full-Text Search

Full-text search is available, but the Dart specific documentation for full-text
search is not available yet.

Since the Dart API is very similar to the Swift API, you can refer to the
[Swift documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/couchbase-lite/current/swift/fts.html)
in the meantime.
