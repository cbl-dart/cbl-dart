# Active Peer

Peer-to-peer sync is available, but the Dart specific documentation for the
active peer is not available yet.

Since the Dart API is very similar to the Swift API, you can refer to the
[Swift documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/couchbase-lite/current/swift/p2psync-websocket-using-active.html)
in the meantime.
