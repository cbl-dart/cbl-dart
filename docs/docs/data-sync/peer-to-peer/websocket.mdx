# Data Sync Peer-to-Peer

<EnterpriseFeatureCallout />

## Introduction

Couchbase Lite's Peer-to-Peer synchronization solution offers secure storage and
bidirectional data synchronization between edge devices without needing a
centralized cloud-based control point.

Couchbase Lite's Peer-to-Peer data synchronization provides:

- Instant WebSocket-based listener for use in Peer-to-Peer applications
  communicating over IP-based networks.

- Simple application development, enabling sync with a short amount of code.

- Optimized network bandwidth usage and reduced data transfer costs with Delta
  Sync support.

- Securely sync data with built-in support for Transport Layer Security (TLS)
  encryption and authentication support.

- Document management. Reducing conflicts in concurrent writes with built-in
  conflict management support.

- Built-in network resiliency.

## Overview

Peer-to-Peer synchronization requires one Peer to act as the Listener to the
other Peer's replicator.

![Listener Diagram](/img/docs-listener-diagram.png)

Peer-to-Peer synchronization requires one Peer to act as the Listener to the
other Peer's replicator. Therefore, to use Peer-to-Peer synchronization in your
application, you must configure one Peer to act as a Listener using the
Couchbase Listener API, the most important of which include
`api|UrlEndpointListener` and `api|UrlEndpointListenerConfiguration`.

<CodeExample id={1} title="Simple Workflow">

1. Configure the Listener (_passive peer_, or _server_).
2. Initialize the Listener, which listens for incoming WebSocket connections (on
   a user-defined, or auto-selected, port).
3. Configure a replicator (_active peer_, or _client_).
4. Use some form of discovery phase, perhaps with a zero-config protocol such as
   [Bonjour](https://developer.apple.com/bonjour/), or use known URL endpoints,
   to identify a Listener.
5. Point the replicator at the Listener.
6. Initialize the replicator.
7. Replicator and Listener engage in the configured security protocol exchanges
   to confirm connection.
8. If connection is confirmed then replication will commence, synchronizing the
   two data stores.

</CodeExample>

Here you can see configuration involves a
[Passive Peer](/data-sync/peer-to-peer/passive-peer) and an
[Active Peer](/data-sync/peer-to-peer/active-peer) and a user-friendly Listener
configuration in [Basic Setup](#basic-setup).

## Features

Couchbase Lite for Dart's Peer-to-Peer synchronization solution provides support
for cross-platform synchronization, for example, between Android and iOS
devices.

Each listener instance serves a single Couchbase Lite database, enabling
synchronization for documents within specified collections of that database.

Having a Listener on a database still allows you to open replications to the
other clients. For example, a Listener can actively begin replicating to other
Listeners while listening for connections. These replications can be for the
same or a different database.

The Listener will automatically select a port to use or a user-specified port.
It will also listen on all available networks, unless you specify a specific
network.

### Security

Couchbase Lite's Peer-to-Peer synchronization supports encryption and
authentication over TLS with multiple modes, including:

- No encryption, for example, clear text.
- CA Cert
- Self-signed Cert
- Anonymous Self-signed — an auto-generated anonymous TLS identity is generated
  if no identity is specified. This TLS identity provides encryption but **not**
  authentication.

The replicator (client) can handle certificates pinned by the Listener for
authentication purposes.

Support is also provided for basic authentication using username and password
credentials. Whilst this can be used in clear text mode, developers are strongly
advised to use TLS encryption.

For testing and development purposes, support is provided for the client
(active, replicator) to skip verification of self-signed certificates; this mode
should not be used in production.

### Error Handling

When a Listener is stopped, then all connected replicators are notified by a
WebSocket error. Your application should distinguish between transient and
permanent connectivity errors.

#### Passive peers

A Passive Peer losing connectivity with an Active Peer will clean up any
associated endpoint connections to that Peer. The Active Peer may attempt to
reconnect to the Passive Peer.

#### Active peers

An Active Peer permanently losing connectivity with a Passive Peer will cease
replicating.

An Active Peer temporarily losing connectivity with a passive Peer will use
exponential backoff functionality to attempt reconnection.

### Delta Sync

Optional delta-sync support is provided but is inactive by default.

Delta-sync can be enabled on a per-replication basis provided that the databases
involved are also configured to permit it.

### Conflict Resolution

Conflict resolution for Peer-to-Peer synchronization works in the same way as it
does for Sync Gateway replication, with both custom and automatic resolution
available.

## Constraints

- Requires at least iOS 10 (dependency on keychains)
- Persisted `api|TlsIdentity`s are not supported yet on Android
  ([#779](https://github.com/cbl-dart/cbl-dart/issues/779)) and Linux. You can
  use `api|KeyPair.fromExternal` to implement your own solution for secure
  storage of private keys.

## Basic Setup

You can configure a Peer-to-Peer synchronization with just a short amount of
code as shown here in [Example 2](#) and [Example 3](#).

<CodeExample id={2} title="Simple Listener">

This simple listener configuration will give you a listener ready to participate
in an encrypted synchronization with a replicator providing a valid user name
and password.

```dart
// 1.
final config = UrlEndpointListenerConfiguration(collections: [collection]);

// 2.
config.authenticator = ListenerPasswordAuthenticator((username, password) {
  return username == "valid.user" && password == "valid.pass";
});

// 3.
final listener = await UrlEndpointListener.create(config);

// 4.
await listener.start();
```

1. Initialize the Listener configuration.
2. Configure the client authenticator to require basic authentication.
3. Initialize the Listener.
4. Start the Listener.

</CodeExample>

<CodeExample id={3} title="Simple Replicator">

This simple replicator configuration will give you an encrypted, bi-directional
Peer-to-Peer synchronization with automatic conflict resolution.

```dart
// 1.
final targetEndpoint = UrlEndpoint(Uri.parse("wss://10.1.1.12:8092/otherDB"));

// 2.
final config = ReplicatorConfiguration(target: targetEndpoint)
  ..addCollection(collection);

// 3.
config.acceptOnlySelfSignedServerCertificate = true;

// 4.
config.authenticator = BasicAuthenticator(
  username: "valid.user",
  password: "valid.pass",
);

// 5
final replicator = await Replicator.create(config);

// 6.
await replicator.start();
```

1. Get the Listener's endpoint. Here we use a known URL, but it could be a URL
   established dynamically in a discovery phase.
2. Initialize the replicator configuration with the collection to be
   synchronized and the endpoint of the Listener it is to be synchronize with.
3. Configure the replicator to expect a self-signed certificate from the
   Listener.
4. Configure the replicator to present basic authentication credentials if the
   Listener prompts for them (client authentication is optional).
5. Initialize the replicator.
6. Start the replicator.

</CodeExample>

## API Highlights

### `UrlEndpointListener`

The `api|UrlEndpointListener` is the listener for peer-to-peer synchronization.
It acts like a passive replicator, in the same way that Sync Gateway does in a
'standard' replication. On the client side, the listener's endpoint is used to
point the replicator to the listener.

Core functionalities of the listener are:

- Users can initialize the class using a `api|UrlEndpointListenerConfiguration`
  object.
- The listener can be started, or can be stopped.
- Once the listener is started, a total number of connections or active
  connections can be checked.

### `UrlEndpointListenerConfiguration`

Use this to create a configuration object you can then use to initialize the
listener.

#### `port`

This is the port that the listener will listen to.

If the port is null or zero, the listener will auto-assign an available port to
listen on.

Default value is null.

#### `networkInterface`

Use this to select a specific Network Interface to use, in the form of the IP
Address or network interface name.

If the network interface is specified, only that interface will be used.

If the network interface is not specified, all available network interfaces will
be used.

#### `disableTls`

You can use `api|UrlEndpointListenerConfiguration`'s `disableTls` property to
disable TLS communication if necessary.

The `disableTls` setting must be `false` when _Client Cert Authentication_ is
required.

Basic Authentication can be used with, or without, TLS.

`disableTls` works in conjunction with `tlsIdentity`, to enable developers to
define the key and certificate to be used.

- If `disableTls` is true — TLS communication is disabled and TLS identity is
  ignored. Active peers will use the `ws://` URL scheme used to connect to the
  listener.
- If `disableTls` is false or not specified — TLS communication is enabled.

Active peers will use the `wss://` URL scheme to connect to the listener.

#### `tlsIdentity`

Use `api|UrlEndpointListenerConfiguration`'s `tlsIdentity` property to configure
the TLS Identity used in TLS communication.

If `api|TlsIdentity` is not set, then the listener uses an auto-generated
anonymous self-signed identity (unless `disableTls = true`). Whilst the client
cannot use this to authenticate the server, it will use it to encrypt
communication, giving a more secure option than non-TLS communication.

When the listener is not started, the identity is null. When TLS is disabled,
the identity is always null.

#### `authenticator`

Use this to specify the authenticator the listener uses to authenticate the
client's connection request. This should be set to one of the following:

- `api|ListenerPasswordAuthenticator`
- `api|ListenerCertificateAuthenticator`
- `null` — there is no authentication.

#### `readOnly`

Use this to allow only pull replication. Default value is false.

#### `enableDeltaSync`

The option to enable Delta Sync and replicate only changed data also depends on
the delta sync settings at database level. The default value is false.

## Security

Couchbase Lite's Peer-to-Peer synchronization ensures secure communication
through TLS and supports multiple authentication mechanisms.

### TLS Identity

The `api|UrlEndpointListener` uses a TLS identity to establish secure
connections. (A TLS identity is an RSA public/private key pair and certificate.)
The identity can include either a certificate signed by a trusted Certificate
Authority (CA), or a self-signed certificate. If no identity is specified, the
listener automatically generates an anonymous, self-signed certificate, which is
primarily used for encryption, but not for authentication.

When replicating with a listener that uses a self-signed certificate, the
replicator (client) can be configured to skip certificate validation. This
option is useful for development or testing, but not recommended for production.

:::note

The minimum supported version of TLS is TLS 1.2.

:::

### Authentication Mechanisms

The `api|UrlEndpointListener` supports two authentication mechanisms:

- Basic Authentication, using a username and password.
- Certificate Authentication, which authenticates clients using client
  certificates, and is only available when TLS is enabled.

### Using Secure Storage

TLS and its associated keys and certificates might require using secure storage
to minimize the chances of a security breach. The implementation of this storage
differs from platform to platform. This table summarizes the secure storage used
to store keys and certificates.
