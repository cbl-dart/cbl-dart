# Scopes and Collections

:::info At a Glance

**Use collections to organize your content in a database**

For example, if your database contains travel information, airport documents can
be assigned to an airports collection, hotel documents can be assigned to a
hotels collection, and so on.

- Document names must be unique within their collection.

**Use scopes to group multiple collections**

Collections can be assigned to different scopes according to content-type or
deployment-phase (for example, test versus production).

- Collection names must be unique within their scope.

:::

## Default Scopes and Collections

Every database you create contains a default scope and a default collection
named `_default`.

If you create a document in the database and don't specify a specific scope or
collection, it is saved in the default collection, in the default scope.

If you upgrade from a version of Couchbase Lite prior to support for scops and
collections, all existing data is automatically placed in the default scope and
default collection.

The default scope and collection cannot be dropped.

## Create a Scope and Collection

In addition to the default scope and collection, you can create your own scope
and collection when you create a document.

Naming conventions for collections and scopes:

- Must be between 1 and 251 characters in length.
- Can only contain the characters `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, and the symbols `_`, `-`,
  and `%`.
- Cannot start with `_` or `%`.
- Scope names must be unique in databases.
- Collection names must be unique within a scope.

:::note

Scope and collection names are case sensitive.

:::

<CodeExample id={1} title="Create a scope and collection">

```dart
final collection = await database.createCollection('myCollectionName', 'myScopeName');
```

</CodeExample>

In the example above, you can see that `api|Database.createCollection` can take
two parameters. The second is the scope assigned to the created collection, if
this parameter is omitted then a collection of the given name will be assigned
to the `_default` scope.

The first parameter is the name of the collection you want to create, in this
case `myCollectionName`.

If a collection with the specified name already exists in the specified scope,
`api|Database.createCollection` returns the existing collection.

:::note

You cannot create an empty user-defined scope. A scope is implicitly created and
removed by the `api|Database.createCollection` and
`api|Database.deleteCollection` methods.

## Index a Collection

<CodeExample id={2} title="Index a Collection">

```dart
final config = FullTextIndexConfiguration(['overview']);
await collection.createIndex('overviewFTSIndex', config);
```

</CodeExample>

## Drop a Collection

<CodeExample id={3} title="Drop a Collection">

```dart
await database.deleteCollection('myCollectionName', 'myScopeName');
```

</CodeExample>

## List Scopes and Collections

<CodeExample id={4} title="List Scopes and Collections">

```dart
final scopes = await database.scopes;
final collections = await database.collections('myScopeName');
print(
  'I have ${scopes.length} scopes and ${collections.length} collections '
  'in scope "myScopeName"',
);
```

</CodeExample>
