/** \defgroup TLSIdentity   TLSIdentity
    @{
    TLSIdentity represents identity information, including an RSA key pair and certificates,
    used for server or client authentication as well as data encryption / decryption in
    TLS communication.
 
    Couchbase Lite C provides functions for generating a new self-signed identity or
    using an existing identity. Similar to other Couchbase Lite platforms, when using
    Couchbase Lite C, a generated self-signed identity can be persisted using a specified
    label in the secure key storage, depending on the operating system as follows:
 
    ##Apple (macOS and iOS) & Windows
    The generated identity will be stored in the platform’s secure key storage as follows:
    - **Apple:** The identity is stored in the Keychain.
    - **Windows:** The identity is stored in CNG Key Storage Provider
 
    ##Linux and Android
    Due to the limitation that Linux-based operating systems do not have a standard or
    common secure key storage, and Android doesn’t support native C/C++ API access
    to the default keystore, Couchbase Lite C does not support persisting generated
    identities with the specified label on these platforms.

    Alternatively, Couchbase Lite C allows developers to implement their own
    cryptographic operations through a set of callbacks, enabling certificate signing
    and data encryption / decryption using a private key stored in their preferred
    secure key storage. The key idea is that all cryptographic operations are performed
    within the secure key storage without exposing the private key.
