# üîå Getting Started

1. After setting up your app for use with [`cbl`][cbl], add `cbl_generator` and
   `build_runner` as development dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dev_dependencies:
     cbl_generator: ...
     build_runner: ...
   ```

2. Annotate Dart code with [typed data annotations][typed data docs].

3. Run the build runner to invoke the generator:
   ```shell
   dart run build_runner build
   # or
   flutter run build_runner build
   ```

# üí° Where to go next

- Check out the example app in the **Example** tab.
- Look at the usage examples for [`cbl`][cbl].
