This package is required to use `cbl` in Flutter apps.

The Couchbase Lite API is provided by [`cbl`][cbl], which you always need, to
use Couchbase Lite. Which other packages you need depends on the target platform
and features you want to use:

# üéØ Platform Support

|     Platform | Version                |
| -----------: | :--------------------- |
|          iOS | >= 10.0                |
|        macOS | >= 10.14               |
|      Android | >= 22                  |
| Linux **\*** | == Ubuntu 20.04-x86_64 |
|      Windows | >= 10                  |

**\***: üêõ Currently broken because of a
[bug in Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/66575). Most notably,
operations trying to return an error crash the app.

# üîå Getting started

1. Add [`cbl`][cbl] and `cbl_flutter` as dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     cbl: ...
     cbl_flutter: ...
   ```

2. Select the edition of Couchbase Lite you want to use, by adding as a
   dependency either [`cbl_flutter_ce`](https://pub.dev/packages/cbl_flutter_ce)
   for the Community Edition or
   [`cbl_flutter_ee`](https://pub.dev/packages/cbl_flutter_ee) for the
   Enterprise Edition:

   ```yaml
   # This dependency selects the Couchbase Lite Community Edition.
   cbl_flutter_ce: ...
   ```

   > ‚öñÔ∏è You need to comply with the Couchbase licensing terms of the edition of
   > Couchbase Lite you select.

3. Make sure you have set the required minimum target version in the build
   systems of the platforms you support.

4. Initialize Couchbase Lite before using it:

   ```dart
   import 'dart:io';

   import 'package:cbl_flutter/cbl_flutter.dart';
   import 'package:cbl_flutter_ce/cbl_flutter_ce.dart';

   Future<void> initCouchbaseLite() async {
     await CouchbaseLiteFlutter.init();
   }
   ```

# Default database directory

When opening a database without specifying a directory,
[`path_provider`][path_provider]'s `getApplicationSupportDirectory` is used to
resolve it. See that function's documentation for the concrete locations on the
various platforms.

# üß™ Flutter unit tests

Flutter unit tests are executed by a headless version of Flutter, on the
development host.

You can use the `cbl` package in your unit tests, but you need to use
[`cbl_dart`][cbl_dart] to initialize Couchbase Lite, instead of `cbl_flutter`:

```dart
import 'dart:io';

import 'package:cbl/cbl.dart';
import 'package:cbl_dart/cbl_dart.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';

void main() {
  setUpAll(() async {
    // If no `filesDir` is specified when initializing CouchbaseLiteDart, the
    // working directory is used as the default database directory.
    // By specifying a `filesDir` here, we can ensure that the tests don't
    // create databases in the project directory.
    final tempFilesDir = await Directory.systemTemp.createTemp();
    await CouchbaseLiteDart.init(edition: Edition.community, filesDir: tempFilesDir.path);
  });

  test('use a database', () async {
    final db = await Database.openAsync('test');
    await db.saveDocument(MutableDocument({'message': 'Hello, World!'}));
    await db.close();
  });
}
```

Unit tests are the best way to **learn, experiment and validate ideas**, since
they launch much quicker than integration tests. Be aware though, that using
Couchbase Lite like this **cannot replace integration testing** your database
code on actual devices or even simulators.

These tests can validate that you're using Couchbase Lite correctly and the code
works as expected generally, but subtle differences between platforms, operating
system versions and devices can still crop up.

- Check out the example app in the **Example** tab.
- Look at the usage examples for [`cbl`][cbl] (go to the latest prerelease).
