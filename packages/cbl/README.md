## Installation

This package only contains Dart code and requires binary libraries to be
packaged with any app that wants to use it. For Flutter apps, you need to add
[`cbl_flutter`](https://pub.dev/packages/cbl_flutter) as a dependency to include
those libraries in the build. `cbl_flutter` currently supports iOS, macOS and
Android.

```pubspec
dependencies:
    cbl: ...
    cbl_flutter: ...
```

## Getting started

Make sure you have set the required minimum target version in the build systems
of the platforms you support.

Before you access any part of the library, `CouchbaseLite` needs to be
initialized with a configuration of how to load the binary libraries.

```dart
import 'package:cbl/cbl.dart';
import 'package:cbl_flutter/cbl_flutter.dart';

void initCbl() {
  CouchbaseLite.init(libraries: flutterLibraries());
}
```

Now you can use `Database.open` to open a database:

```dart
import 'package:cbl/cbl.dart';
import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';

Future<void> useDatabase() async {
  final db = await Database.openAsync('chat-messages');

  final doc = MutableDocument({
    'type': 'message',
    'body': 'Heyo',
    'from': 'Alice',
  });

  await db.saveDocument(doc);

  await db.close();
}
```
