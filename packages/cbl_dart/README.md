Couchbase Lite is an embedded, NoSQL JSON Document Style database, supporting
Blobs, Encryption, N1QL Queries, Live Queries, Full-Text Search and Data Sync.

It can be used as a standalone embedded database for mobile or desktop apps. Or
it can be combined with [Sync Gateway] to synchronize with a central data store.

**What are all these packages for?**

Couchbase Lite can be used with **standalone Dart** or with **Flutter** apps and
comes in two editions: **Community** and **Enterprise**.

Regardless of the app platform and edition of Couchbase Lite you use, you always
need the `cbl` package. All of the APIs of Couchbase Lite live in this package.

What other packages you need depends on the app platform and the edition of
Couchbase Lite you use.

# 🎯 Platform Support

| Platform | Version                |
| -------: | :--------------------- |
|    macOS | >= 10.14               |
|    Linux | == Ubuntu 20.04-x86_64 |
|  Windows | >= 10                  |

# 🔌 Getting Started

1. Add [`cbl`][cbl] and `cbl_dart` as dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     cbl: ...
     cbl_dart: ...
   ```

1. Initialize Couchbase Lite before using it. This is also where you select the
   edition of Couchbase Lite you want to use:

   ```dart
   import 'package:cbl_dart/cbl_dart.dart';

   Future<void> initCouchbaseLite() async {
     await CouchbaseLiteDart.init(edition: Edition.community);
   }
   ```

   Note that `init` downloads the needed native libraries if they have not
   already been cached. See the documentation for
   [`CouchbaseLiteDart.init`](https://pub.dev/documentation/cbl_dart/latest/cbl_dart/CouchbaseLiteDart/init.html)
   for more information.

   > ⚖️ You need to comply with the Couchbase licensing terms of the edition of
   > Couchbase Lite you select.

# Default database directory

When opening a database without specifying a directory, the current working
directory will be used. `CouchbaseLiteDart.init` allows you to specify a
different default directory.

# 💡 Where to go next

- Check out the example app in the **Example** tab.
- Look at the usage examples for [`cbl`][cbl].
