/** \defgroup scope   Scope
    @{
    A \ref CBLScope represents a scope or namespace of the collections.
 
    The scope implicitly exists when there is at least one collection created under the scope.
    The default scope is exceptional in that it will always exists even there are no collections
    under it.
 
    ## `CBLScope` Lifespan
    `CBLScope` is ref-counted. Same as the CBLCollection, the CBLScope objects
    retrieved from the database must be released after you are done using them.
    When the database is closed or released, the scope objects will become invalid,
    most operations on the invalid \ref CBLCollection object will fail with
    \ref kCBLErrorNotOpen error result. */
