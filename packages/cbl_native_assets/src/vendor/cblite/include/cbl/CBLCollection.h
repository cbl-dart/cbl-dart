CBL_CAPI_BEGIN

/** \defgroup collection   Collection
    @{
    A \ref CBLCollection represent a collection which is a container for documents.
 
    A collection can be thought as a table in the relational database. Each collection belongs to
    a scope which is simply a namespce, and has a name which is unique within its scope.
 
    When a new database is created, a default collection named "_default" will be automatically
    created. The default collection is created under the default scope named "_default".
    The name of the default collection and scope can be referenced by using
    \ref kCBLDefaultCollectionName and \ref kCBLDefaultScopeName constant.
 
    @note The default collection cannot be deleted.
 
    When creating a new collection, the collection name, and the scope name are required.
    The naming rules of the collections and scopes are as follows:
    - Must be between 1 and 251 characters in length.
    - Can only contain the characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and the symbols _, -, and %.
    - Cannot start with _ or %.
    - Both scope and collection names are case sensitive.
 
    ## `CBLCollection` Lifespan
    `CBLCollection` is ref-counted. Same as the CBLDocument, the CBLCollection objects
    created or retrieved from the database must be released after you are done using them.
    When the database is closed or released, the collection objects will become invalid,
    most operations on the invalid \ref CBLCollection object will fail with either the
    \ref kCBLErrorNotOpen error or null/zero/empty result.
 
    ##Legacy Database and API
    When using the legacy database, the existing documents and indexes in the database will be
    automatically migrated to the default collection.
 
    Any pre-existing database functions that refer to documents, listeners, and indexes without
    specifying a collection such as \ref CBLDatabase_GetDocument will implicitly operate on
    the default collection. In other words, they behave exactly the way they used to, but
    collection-aware code should avoid them and use the new Collection API instead.
    These legacy functions are deprecated and will be removed eventually.
