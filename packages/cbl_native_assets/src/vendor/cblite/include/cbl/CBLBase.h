    return the object with a ref-count of 1; you are responsible for releasing the reference
    when you're done with it, or the object will be leaked.

    Other functions that return an **existing** ref-counted object do not modify its ref-count.
    You do _not_ need to release such a reference. But if you're keeping a reference to the object
    for a while, you should retain the reference to ensure it stays alive, and then release it when

/** \defgroup listeners   Listeners
     @{
    Every API function that registers a listener callback returns an opaque token representing
    the registered callback. To unregister any type of listener, call \ref CBLListener_Remove.

    The steps to creating a listener are:
    1. Define the type of contextual information the callback needs. This is usually one of
        your objects, or a custom struct.
    2. Implement the listener function:
      - The parameters and return value must match the callback defined in the API.
      - The first parameter is always a `void*` that points to your contextual
          information, so cast that to the actual pointer type.
      - **The function may be called on a background thread!** And since the CBL API is not itself
          thread-safe, you'll need to take special precautions if you want to call the API
          from your listener, such as protecting all of your calls (inside and outside the
          listener) with a mutex. It's safer to use \ref CBLDatabase_BufferNotifications to
          schedule listener callbacks to a time of your own choosing, such as your thread's
          event loop; see that function's docs for details.
    3. To register the listener, call the relevant `AddListener` function.
      - The parameters will include the CBL object to observe, the address of your listener
        function, and a pointer to the contextual information. (That pointer needs to remain
        valid for as long as the listener is registered, so it can't be a pointer to a local
        variable.)
      - The return value is a \ref CBLListenerToken pointer; save that.
    4. To unregister the listener, pass the \ref CBLListenerToken to \ref CBLListener_Remove.
      - You **must** unregister the listener before the contextual information pointer is
        invalidated, e.g. before freeing the object it points to.
